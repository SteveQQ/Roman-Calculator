All *Roman Symbol* : "I", "V", "X", "L", "C", "D", "M"

Rules of *Roman Algebra* that should be considered in this project:
*Symbols can be concatenated in order to create larger numbers
 e.g XX = 20
*If lower number is placed before larger number subtraction is made
 e.g IV = 4
*Symbols: "I", "X", "C" can occur no more than 3 times in a row
*Symbols "V", "L", "D" can occur only once in one number
